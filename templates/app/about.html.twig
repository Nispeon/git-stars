                        Since it apparently isn't supported anymore we thought we'd take the concept back and add our own touch to it.

                                    <p>Hi, my name's Julien and I'm a student in web development in Paris.<br>
                                        This website was made during my internship with Pierre in the transition between
                                        my 2nd and 3rd year of college. <br>
                                        It was supposed to be work, but it turned out to be a really fun exercise, and it
                                        taught me a lot of PHP and coding in general. <br>
                                        I'm not the most skillful developer out there (yet!), but I certainly aim to get better
                                        and I'd be happy to talk about development with you, it's always a great way to learn new stuff!<br>
                                        Feel free to reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nispeon" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and in the meantime, enjoy your visit on Git-stars! <i class="fas fa-star text-warning"></i></p>

                                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                                    <p class="fst-italic">It's really not that complicated, though it still required some real thinking.</p>
                                    <p>Without going into details, we are fetching data from GitHub through their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" target="_blank">API</a>
                                        and store it in our database.<br>
                                        Then whenever we find that someone has written something in the "location" input on their account, we
                                        use the <a target="_blank" href="https://photon.komoot.io/">Photon API</a> to geolocate it,
                                        and from there we can create our region-based rankings.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">
                                        There's over 56 million Github profiles though, how will you fetch all that?</h4>
                                    <p>Well fetching everything is no easy task.<br>
                                        To get all that info, little by little, we have automated the fetching process, and the website is always filling up!<br>
                                        We put a priority on active users though, as to get the most relevant accounts first.
                                        <br>We've also put in place a priority-queue, so that whenever anyone looks for a user on the website,
                                        it's profile is immediately added to our database.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">
                                        There's a limit of 5000 calls per hour on the Github API, getting everything will take over a year won't it?</h4>
                                    <p>If you ask that, then you must be more acquainted with the API than we were when we started. <br>
                                        But no sweat! You might have noticed that you need to register on the website with your GitHub account to do certain actions on the website,<br>
                                        Well when you do, we get access to a token created as a link between your account and our application, and it allows us to do two things:
                                        <br><br>
                                        1 - Get access to th information about your public repositories (and only that!), so nothing anyone couldn't already get,
                                        <br>
                                        2 - Call the API with that token that specifically was created for our app, so no downsize for you at all!
                                        <br><br>
                                        What that means is that by registering over here, you allow us to fill our database even faster, without giving us any info or anything,
