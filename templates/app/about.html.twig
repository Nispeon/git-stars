                            Since it apparently isn't supported anymore we thought we'd take the concept back and add our own touch to it.

                                            Hola! I'm Pierre, born and raised in Paris ü•ñ.
                                            I proposed this project to Julien for the beginning of his internship with me.<br>
                                            The main idea was to train him on PHP, Symfony and a very large database,
                                            but also to discover other ways of processing data, asynchronously with RabbitMQ and the Symfony Messenger component. <br>
                                            For me, the biggest challenge was to get a lot of data from Github, aggregate it and have good performance on our website.<br>
                                            Drop me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/pgrimaud_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or feel free to open an issue on the repository.

                                            Hi, my name's Julien and I'm a student in web development in Paris.<br>
                                            This website was made during my internship with Pierre in the transition between
                                            my 2nd and 3rd year of college. <br>
                                            It was supposed to be work, but it turned out to be a really fun exercise, and it
                                            taught me a lot of PHP and coding in general. <br>
                                            I'm not the most skillful developer out there (yet!), but I certainly aim to get better
                                            and I'd be happy to talk about development with you, it's always a great way to learn new stuff!<br>
                                            Feel free to reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nispeon"  rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and in the meantime, enjoy your visit on Git Stars! <i class="fas fa-star text-warning"></i></p>

                                        <p class="fst-italic">It's really not that complicated, though it still required some real thinking.</p>
                                        <p>Without going into details, we are fetching data from GitHub through their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"   >API</a>
                                            and store it in our database.<br>
                                            Then whenever we find that someone has written something in the "location" input on their account, we
                                            use the <a target="_blank" href="https://photon.komoot.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon API</a> to geolocate it,
                                            and from there we can create our region-based rankings.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">
                                            There's over 56 million Github profiles though, how will you fetch all that?</h4>
                                        <p>Well fetching everything is no easy task.<br>
                                            To get all that info, little by little, we have automated the fetching process, and the website is always filling up!<br>
                                            We put a priority on active users though, as to get the most relevant accounts first.
                                            <br>We've also put in place a priority-queue, so that whenever anyone looks for a user on the website,
                                            it's profile is immediately added to our database.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">
                                            There's a limit of 5000 calls per hour on the Github API, getting everything will take over a year won't it?</h4>
                                        <p>If you ask that, then you must be more acquainted with the API than we were when we started. <br>
                                            But no sweat! You might have noticed that you need to register on the website with your GitHub account to do certain actions on the website,<br>
                                            Well when you do, we get access to a token created as a link between your account and our application, and it allows us to do two things:
                                            <br><br>
                                            1 - Get access to the information about your public repositories (and only that!), so nothing anyone couldn't already get,
                                            <br>
                                            2 - Call the API with that token that specifically was created for our app, so no downsize for you at all!
                                            <br><br>
                                            What that means is that by registering over here, you allow us to fill our database even faster, without giving us any info or anything,

                                            Users of the day are randomly selected among the many users on our website.<br>
                                            There are two conditions to be selected:
                                            <br><br>
                                            1 - Having at least 250 stargazers, this is to avoid selecting inactive users,
                                            <br>
                                            2 - Having your twitter handle on your GitHub profile, we tweet our selected users everyday and @ them on Twitter so that's a requirement.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Once these two conditions are respected, you will enter the random pool from which our app draws each day.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-4">
                                            Why is the location on my profile wrong?</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            The location on your profile comes from the location field on your GitHub profile.<br>
                                            All we do is send it to the <a target="_blank" href="https://photon.komoot.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon API</a>
                                            to try and turn it into a real address.<br><br>
                                            But the API can be wrong, especially when the place entered isn't a real one.<br>
                                            In that case, you have several options:
                                            <br><br>
                                            1 - Fix the location on your GitHub profile directly and then refresh your account on Git Stars,
                                            <br>
                                            2 - Reach us on Twitter to tell us,
                                            <br>
                                            3 (the best one) - Fork our repository and add your GitHub location to the <a href="https://github.com/pgrimaud/git-stars/blob/master/src/Service/GeocodeService.php" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fixLocation function</a>,
                                            to change it into something more recognizable (it will not change the location that appears on your profile)
                                            <br><br>
